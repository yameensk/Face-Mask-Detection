# Face-Mask-Detection

This project, which addresses the urgent need for safety precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrates my proficiency in computer vision, Arduino programming, and Python integration.

The main goal of this project was to use Python to build a model for face mask detection. By utilising the strength of OpenCV and TensorFlow, I developed a unique model to precisely identify whether people are donning face masks. The model provides real-time recognition and categorization of faces with or without masks by combining image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.

I used Pyfirmata, a Python package for interacting with Arduino boards, to enable smooth communication between the Python programme and the board. The face mask detection model and the physical components controlled by Arduino may be coordinated easily thanks to Pyfirmata.I incorporated a door lock mechanism using servos driven by an Arduino to show how the face mask detection system could be used in practise. The device starts the servo motors to secure the door when it detects someone without a mask, blocking access. Conversely, the servos unlock the door and let admission when a person wearing a mask is recognised.

This device offers a dependable and effective method for enforcing mask-wearing policies in varied circumstances by integrating face mask detection algorithms with Arduino-controlled servos. It may be quickly installed in doors, access points, or any other place that needs automated control and monitoring. It demonstrates my capacity to create creative solutions that make use of the strengths of both software (Python) and hardware (Arduino) platforms.
